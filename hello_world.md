# Hello, world!
Seriously, do we really have to do `Hello, world` every time we learn how to write a program?

Well, I'd feel like I were leaving something out if I didn't.  So were' going to add one line
of code to a file that crystal created.

In the `./src/` directory, you'll find `stpete_crystal.cr`.  Add the line right where the code
tells you to (seriously, the generator added `# Put your code here`, how cool is that?)

```crystal
module StpeteCrystal
  # TODO Put your code here
  puts "Hello, world!"
end
```

Ok, drumroll plase.  From the `stpete_crystal` folder run your app (__do not forget the .cr
exteions__)

```bash
crystal src/stpete_crystal.cr
```

And lo and behold, look what happens!

```bash
Hello, world!
```

Modern technology never ceases to amaze me.  But let's just show a couple more things.  First,
we have to personalize `hello world`.  I think it's mandatory once you've invoked it.
